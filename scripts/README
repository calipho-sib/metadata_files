This directory contains scripts for updating the metadata.txt records related to PeptideAtlas and MassIVE sets

--------------------
For MassIVE
--------------------
1) get_massive_fnames_from_metadata.py

This scripts reads ../metadata.txt and extracts the name of the files in CC lines of MassIVE sets.
It is useful to use it to compare the files expected by metadata and those delivered by MassIVE in their new data folder
Ti be used for adding / updating records in metadata.txt (add missing MDATA records / modify CC lines for MassIVE sets)

2) rewrite_massive_metadata.py

This script needs 2 input files in this folder:

- metadata.txt    : a fresh copy of ../metadata.txt
- experiments.tsv : the 6 columns file provided with the new data from MassIVE descibing samples and sets

The script reads experiments.tsv to build a dictionary associating set name and its related pubmed ids.
Based on this dictionary, the scripts writes a new file metadata.massive.new by rewriting all the lines of the input file metadata.txt
except the DR lines of MassIVE sets which are modified according to the dictionary associating data sets and pubmed ids.

Output: metadata.massive.new

--------------------
For PeptideAtlas
--------------------

1) rewrite_peptide_atlas_metadata.py

This script needs 2 input files in this folder:

- metadata.txt      : a fresh copy of ../metadata.txt
- Hs_All_sample.tsv : the 6 columns file provided with the new data from PeptideAtlas descibing samples and sets

The script reads Hs_All_sample.tsv to build a dictionary associating set name and its related pubmed ids and a second dictionaty associating set name and samples (1st column).
Based on these dictionaries, the scripts writes a new file metadata.peptiede_atlas.new by rewriting all the lines of the input file metadata.txt
except the CC lines and DR lines of PeptideAtlas sets which are modified according to the dictionaries associating data sets with pubmed ids and samples.

Output: metadata.peptide_atlas.new

-------------- obsolete scripts -----------------

The process will update 
- DR lines : update the pubmed list of every PeptideAtlas set
- CC lines : update CC lines dediated to the sample list of every PeptideAtlas set

The input files to be copied in this directory are:

- metadata.txt           
  the latest version of metatdata to be found at /share/sib/common/Calipho/np/metadata_files/

- cv_datasources.txt
  the latest version of cv_datasources to be found at https://github.com/calipho-sib/controlled-vocabulary

- Hs_All_sample_2019.tsv
  the latest version of samples provided byPeptideAtlas at 
  ftp://pa10:paISB2xx%23@ftp.peptideatlas.org/HumanAll/Hs_All_sample_2019.tsv

The procedure has 3 steps

Step 1
------

./mapCvdatasourceForPeptideAtlas.sh

Generates a file containing a mapping between MDATA ids and Peptide Atlas set names based 
on the content of cv_datasources.txt

=> output : PeptideAtlas.mapinfo

Step 2
------

./mapPeptideAtlasSamplesAndPubmedToMDATA.sh

Generates 2 files containing a mapping of MDATA ids and pubmed ids / sample ids based 
on the content of Hs_All_sample_2019.tsv

=> output : mdata_pmid.tsv
=> output : mdata_spl.tsv

Step 3
------

perl ./rewrite_metadata.pl

Generates a new metadata file based on the content of the current one (metadata.txt) 
and on the new MDATA, pmids, samples associations stored in mdata_pmid.tsv and mdata_spl.tsv.

=> output : metadata.txt.new
